## Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room, a company specializing in interactive gaming experiences, requested a design for a platform-independent system to support their existing game, Draw It or Lose It. They wanted the software to manage multiple teams and players while ensuring seamless scalability and compatibility across devices. This required secure user authentication, efficient game state management, and a design focused on flexibility and maintainability.

## What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

In developing the documentation, I excelled at clearly outlining the requirements and aligning them with the system's goals. My attention to detail ensured that the system design addressed critical aspects like scalability and security while remaining user-focused. Working through the design document helped me structure my ideas systematically, enabling a smooth transition from abstract concepts to actionable code.

## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working through the design document was incredibly helpful because it provided a clear blueprint while developing the code. It helped me break down complex requirements into manageable components and ensured that my implementation aligned with the system's overall goals. Additionally, having a well-defined structure made it easier to anticipate potential challenges and maintain consistency throughout the development process.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I were to revise one part of my work, it would be the evaluation section. Instead of presenting multiple options, I could have focused on identifying and recommending one or two best solutions that align with the system's design. At the time, my unfamiliarity with the options made it challenging to narrow them down effectively. This experience has highlighted the importance of deeper research and clarity in decision-making.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I focused on analyzing their requirements and breaking them into functional components, such as role-based access and team management. Considering user needs is vital to ensure the software aligns with expectations and delivers a positive experience while meeting operational goals.

## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

When designing software, I adopt a structured approach that starts with gathering requirements and creating models and diagrams to visualize the system. In the future, I would use strategies like iterative prototyping, domain modeling, and incorporating user feedback. These techniques ensure the design evolves to meet user needs effectively and remains adaptable to future changes.
